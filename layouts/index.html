<h2>Requestment</h2>
<p>Requirements for installing PPSSPP Emulator are a minimum of Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) and above and an architecture supported by Arm64 (64bit), arm32 (32 bit) and x86_64 (64 bit).
<p>To use PPSSPP smoothly and smoothly when playing games, we recommend that you meet the following specifications:</p>
<h3>Android</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Prosesor :  Use Minimum <i>Qualcomm Snapdragon 435+</i> 
</li>
<li>
Android Version : Android 7 +
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Prosesor : Use Minimum <i>Intel core i3 gen 10 +</i>
</li>
<li>
Windows Version : <i>Windows 7 +</i>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Linux</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Prosesor : Use Minimum <i>Intel core i3 gen 10 +</i>
</li>
<li>
Linux Version : <i>Ubuntu 18.0 +</i>
</li>
</ul>
<h2> How To improve Device performance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use Skia's Vulkan renderer, especially if your device uses a Mali GPU.  but in some games it may not support you can use opengl if that happens.</li>
<li>For some devices using Mali gpu, enabling the <i>Threaded Presentation</i> feature in <i>Advanced Settings</i> can improve performance significantly but in some devices it will crash (for example google pixel 7)</li>
<li>Underclock the CPU, which is able to mimic the performance pipeline by setting the cycle rate to a negative number, and skip cycles to a positive number in System settings.  This will crash some games, and cause crashes when this feature is enabled if the game does not support it.</li>
<li>If the game slows down depending on your eyes, this may be due to the GS download renderer, which is very slow on low spec GPUs.  You can toggle the hardware download mode feature to Asynchronous or Disabled, but this may cause some problems to the app and it may crash.</li>
<li>You could try switching the SPU3's mixing mode to Async Mix instead of Timestretch.  But in some games it is not compatible, it is recommended to try it first.</li>
<li>For some devices (e.g. Sony, Xiaomi, Samsung and Pixel), using affinity control can increase performance to the highest level.</li>
<li>Lowering the number of gpu renders can improve performance, but this will hurt the image quality (suitable for low spec devices).</li>
<li>If after updating the aethersx2 application it becomes slow and the performance seems to be slow, you can delete the data and cache then enter the application again.</li>
<li>Use the <code>OpenGL</code> renderer if your device has low specifications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The PPSSPP emulator is a versatile PSP emulator with a variety of features that enhance the gaming experience. Here are some of its key features:
<ul>
<li> <b>High-Definition Gaming</b>: PPSSPP can run your PSP games on your PC or Android phone in full HD resolution, or even higher.</li>
<li> <b>Texture Upscaling</b>: It can upscale textures to make them sharper.</li>
<li> <b>Post-Processing Shaders</b>: You can enable shaders to adjust color, brightness, and other visual effects.</li>
<li> <b>Save/Restore Game State</b>: Save and restore game state anywhere, anytime.</li>
<li> <b>Customizable Controls</b>: Customize on-screen touch controls or use an external controller or keyboard.</li>
<li> <b>Anisotropic Filtering & Texture Scaling</b>: Improve the graphics with these features.</li>
<li> <b>Transfer Saves</b>: Continue where you left off by transferring saves from your real PSP.</li>
<li> <b>Free & Open Source</b>: PPSSPP is an open-source project, licensed under the GPL 2.0 or later.</li>


<h2>Settings</h2>
We will provide aethersx2 settings that are suitable for your device, so that the experience of using aethersx2 is smoother.  We divide it into two settings, namely <b>Low End</b> for devices with low specifications (device specifications below Snapdragon 870) and <b>High End</b> Devices with high specifications (device specifications above Snapdragon 870).


<h3>Low End Settings</h3>
<h4>Graphics</h4>
<p>This is the biggest performance knob. Focus on lowering these settings first.
<p>Texture Filtering: Set to "None" or "Nearest". This reduces the graphical fidelity but improves speed.
<p>Frame Skipping: Enable "Auto-frameskip" with a moderate "Percent of frames to skip" value (start at 1 and adjust as needed). This allows the emulator to skip frames when necessary to maintain a playable framerate.
<h4>System</h4>
<p>Backend: If your device supports it, try switching to "Vulkan" for potentially better performance. Otherwise, stick with "OpenGL".
<p>Fast Memory (Unstable): This can provide a performance boost on some devices but might cause glitches in some games. Enable it with caution and test individual games.

<h4>Other Settings to Consider</h4>
<p>Resolution: Lowering the in-game resolution can significantly improve performance. Experiment to find a balance between smoothness and visuals.
<p>Effects: Disabling effects like bloom and anti-aliasing can free up resources.

<h4>Additional Tips</h4>
<p>Close Background Apps: Free up as much system memory as possible for PPSSPP by closing any unnecessary apps running in the background.
<p>Lower Device Settings: If your device allows, consider lowering overall system settings like brightness or animations to free up resources.
<p>Try Different PPSSPP Versions: Sometimes, older versions of PPSSPP might run better on low-end devices. You can find older versions online.


<h3>High End Settings</h3>
<p>High-end devices can leverage PPSSPP's settings to crank up the visuals and performance for a fantastic PSP emulation experience. Here's a breakdown of key settings to consider:
<h4>General:</h4>
<p> <b>Graphics:</b> This depends on your preference. For maximum graphical fidelity, choose "Vulkan" (if available) or "OpenGL hardware." Otherwise, "OpenGL software" is a good fallback.
<p> <b>Frameskip:</b> If you experience occasional slowdown, enable "Auto frameskip" and adjust the percentage to maintain a smooth 60 FPS.

<h4>Graphics:</h4>

<p> <b>Texture Filtering:</b> "Anisotropic filtering x16" provides the sharpest textures, but it can be demanding. Experiment with lower levels for a balance between quality and performance.
<p> <b>Bilinear Filtering:</b> Enable this for smoother textures, especially helpful for emulating older games.
<p> <b>Internal Resolution:</b> Crank this up for a sharper image. Experiment with different resolutions (e.g., 2x native PSP resolution) to find the sweet spot between visuals and performance on your device.

<h4>Advanced:</h4>
<p> <b>Hardware Transform:</b> If enabled, the GPU handles 3D transformations, potentially improving performance. However, it might cause graphical glitches in some games. Test it out and see if it works for you.
<p> <b>Disable Alpha Dithering:</b> This can improve image quality, but it might cause transparency issues in certain games.

<h4>Additional Tips:</h4>

<p> <b>Cheats:</b> PPSSPP offers built-in cheat support. You can find cheat codes online for specific games and enable them within the emulator for an advantage.
<p> <b>Save States:</b> Utilize save states to create checkpoints within games, allowing you to resume progress from specific points.
<p> <b>Controls:</b> Customize the on-screen controls for a comfortable gaming experience. You can even connect a Bluetooth controller for a more traditional feel.


<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Force GPU Rendering: enable this feature in device settings <b>Settings</b> > <b>Developer Options</b> > <b>Enable Force GPU Rendering</b>.  Enabling this feature will improve performance and graphic quality but drains battery usage, we recommend deactivating it when not playing games.</li>
<li>Force 4X MSAA: enable this feature in device settings <b>Settings</b> > <b>Developer Options</b> > <b>Enable Force 4x MSAA</b>.  Enabling this feature will improve performance but drains battery usage, we recommend deactivating it when not playing games.</li>
<li>Game Mode: Activate Game Mode if your device provides this feature, game mode on default devices usually provides more effective performance options.</li>
<li>Battery Saver: Make sure you activate battery saver mode on your device to provide maximum performance.</li>
<li>Use a cooler or be in a cool place, so that processor performance remains stable when playing games.  because if your cellphone gets hot, the processor performance will automatically decrease.</li>
<li>Use a USB controller so that control when playing games is easier and more comfortable, this will improve your gaming experience.</li>
</ul>
