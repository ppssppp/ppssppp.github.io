The Snapdragon 870 is a powerful processor that can handle most PPSSPP games at high settings. However, the best configuration will depend on the specific game you're playing and your phone's capabilities. Here's a general guide to get you started:

**Graphics:**

* You can try starting with the default settings and see how the game runs.
* If you experience slowdowns, you can try lowering the resolution. A good starting point might be X2 or X3 (native resolution being X1).
* Experiment with options like "Frame Skipping" and "Hardware Acceleration" (Vulkan is generally preferred if supported by your device).
* **Reduce Artifacts:** This can be set to "Aggressive" for some improvements without a significant visual impact.

**Other Settings:**

* **Audio:**  You can leave the audio settings on default for most games.
* **Controls:** You can customize the on-screen controls to your preference.
* **System:** Leave most system settings on default unless you encounter specific issues.

**Resources:**

* You can also find videos on YouTube showcasing PPSSPP settings for various games on Snapdragon 870 phones. Search for "[YouTube PPSSPP settings SD870 GameName]" (replace "GameName" with the specific game you're interested in).

Remember, the best settings will vary depending on the game. It's best to experiment and find what works best for you. Don't hesitate to adjust the settings as needed to achieve a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience.
