Burnout 3: Takedown throws traditional racing out the window and injects it with a shot of high-octane adrenaline.  Forget clean lines and precision driving; this game is all about causing mayhem on the road.

**Buckle Up for Chaos**

Burnout 3 puts you behind the wheel in a world where your car is a weapon.  Instead of focusing on reaching the finish line first, you'll be rewarded for taking down your rivals and causing spectacular crashes.  Boosting through oncoming traffic, weaving through intersections, and strategically smashing opponents into walls are all part of the Burnout experience.

**Key Features**

* **Aggressive Racing:**  Burnout 3 throws out the rulebook and encourages high-speed takedowns.
* **Crash & Burn:**  The more destruction you cause, the bigger your boost becomes.  Chain together crashes for insane speed and score multipliers.
* **Thrilling Modes:**  Race through a variety of tracks and challenges, from takedown battles to high-speed pursuits.
* **Arcade Fun:**  Pick up and play with intuitive controls and an emphasis on fast-paced action.

**A Timeless Classic**

While released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2, Burnout 3: Takedown remains a beloved title for its breakneck speed and explosive crashes.  If you're looking for a racing game that rewards reckless abandon over clean driving, then Burnout 3 is definitely worth checking out.
