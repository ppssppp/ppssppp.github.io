Released in 2001, Rumble Racing on the PlayStation 2 (PS2) throws players into a high-octane world of arcade racing thrills. Developed by Electronic Arts (EA) and Visceral Games, it takes inspiration from the earlier NASCAR Rumble, but with a distinct twist.

**Gear Up for Wild Rides**

Forget about realistic simulations. Rumble Racing is all about over-the-top action.  Race across 15 wild tracks filled with jumps, ramps, hidden shortcuts, and breakable scenery.  Perform gravity-defying stunts to build your boost meter and unleash a burst of nitrous oxide for an edge over your rivals.

**Choose Your Path to Victory**

Rumble Racing offers a variety of modes to suit your need for speed.  Challenge yourself in the single-player Championship mode to conquer five cups and unlock new tracks.  Test your skills in a single race, or go head-to-head with friends in the competitive multiplayer mode.  For a cooperative twist, team up with a friend and work together to dominate the competition.

**A Garage Full of Muscle**

Rumble Racing boasts a lineup of 35 customizable muscle cars.  Pick your favorite ride, tweak its performance, and paint it with a unique design to make a statement on the track. 

**Feel the Rumble**

Experience the intensity of the race with the power of the PS2's DualShock controller.  Rumble Racing utilizes vibration feedback to put you right in the driver's seat, letting you feel the roar of the engine, the bumps of the road, and the bone-jarring collisions.

**A Blast from the Racing Past**

If you're looking for a PlayStation 2 game that offers a refreshing departure from serious racing sims, Rumble Racing delivers a perfect dose of arcade-style fun.  With its wild tracks, outlandish stunts, and intense competition, it's a game that will keep you coming back for more.
