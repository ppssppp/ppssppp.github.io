Released in late 2009, Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja 5 was one of the final entries in the popular Naruto: Ultimate Ninja series for the PlayStation 2. Developed by CyberConnect2 and published by Bandai Namco Games, it offered a chance for fans to relive the early arcs of Naruto Shippuden on their trusty PS2s.

Here's a breakdown of what Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja 5 brought to the table:

* **Story Mode:** The game's main draw was its Hero Mode, which followed the story of Naruto Shippuden up to the Pain arc. Players could experience key battles and cinematics from the anime, controlling characters like Naruto, Sasuke, and others.

* **Gameplay:** Ultimate Ninja 5 retained the series' signature 3D arena fighting style. Players battled opponents using ninjutsu, taijutsu, and special jutsu recreated from the anime. This entry introduced a new support character system, allowing players to choose a partner who would unleash a powerful attack during combat.

* **Roster:** The game boasted a healthy roster of playable characters, including veterans from previous installments and newcomers like Pain and Deidara. Each character had their own unique moveset and fighting style.

* **Legacy:** While not considered the strongest entry in the series, Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja 5 offered a fun and nostalgic experience for fans of the Naruto franchise on the PS2. It captured the excitement of the early Shippuden arcs and provided a solid fighting game experience.

**Things to Consider:**

* Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja 5 is a PS2 game, so expect visuals and mechanics that may feel dated compared to modern titles.
* The game is no longer in print, so finding a physical copy might require searching online retailers or used game stores.

Overall, Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja 5 is a solid choice for those looking for a classic Naruto fighting game experience on the PlayStation 2.
