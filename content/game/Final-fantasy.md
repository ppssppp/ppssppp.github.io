There seems to be some confusion! Final Fantasy 1, the original game released in 1987 for the NES, never received a port for the PlayStation 2 (PS2). The Final Fantasy series gained immense popularity on the PS2, with titles like Final Fantasy X, X-2, and XII gracing the console. 

Here's a breakdown to clear things up:

* **Final Fantasy 1 (1987):** Released for the NES, this classic RPG laid the foundation for the series. 
* **PlayStation 2 (2000-2013):** This popular Sony console boasted several mainline Final Fantasy titles, but not the original.

There are a couple of possibilities for your confusion:

* **Collections:**  Square Enix released compilation sets that included multiple Final Fantasy games, but none of these collections included Final Fantasy 1 for the PS2.
* **Fan creations:** It's possible you might have come across a rumor or project of a fan-made remake for the PS2. However, there's no official port of Final Fantasy 1 for the PS2.

If you're interested in playing Final Fantasy 1, you can explore other platforms where it's available, such as:

* Original NES version
* Mobile remakes for iOS and Android
* Remasters included in compilation sets for other consoles

On the other hand, if you're looking for a great Final Fantasy experience on the PS2, titles like Final Fantasy X and XII are fantastic options with captivating stories and engaging gameplay.
