Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, released in 2005 for the PlayStation 2, is a beat 'em up action-adventure game developed by Midway Games (now NetherRealm Studios) and published by Midway Games. It's a spin-off of the popular Mortal Kombat fighting game franchise, offering a unique perspective by allowing players to control Liu Kang and Kung Lao directly as they embark on a journey to stop the sorcerer Shang Tsung and his forces from obtaining the powerful artifacts known as the Dragon Medallions.

**Gameplay**

Shaolin Monks deviates from the traditional fighting game style of the Mortal Kombat series. Instead, it presents a third-person beat 'em up experience where players navigate linear levels, battling hordes of enemies using martial arts combos, special attacks, and environmental objects. As Liu Kang and Kung Lao progress, they unlock new abilities and fighting styles, enhancing their combat repertoire.

**Key Features**

* **Dual Character Gameplay:** Switch between Liu Kang and Kung Lao on the fly, utilizing their distinct fighting styles and special moves to overcome challenges.
* **Cooperative Mode:** Team up with a friend for local cooperative gameplay, adding a layer of strategy and camaraderie as you fight side-by-side.
* **Exploration and Puzzles:** Explore diverse environments, uncover secrets, and solve puzzles to advance in the story.
* **Character Progression:** Unlock new fighting styles, special moves, and upgrades for Liu Kang and Kung Lao as you progress through the game.
* **Fatalities:** Execute series-famous finishing moves on defeated enemies, adding a brutal but satisfying element to combat.
* **Secrets and Unlockables:** Discover hidden areas, unlock bonus costumes, and uncover secrets that add replay value to the game.

**Story**

Shaolin Monks takes place after the events of Mortal Kombat II. Shang Tsung, defeated by Liu Kang in the tournament, seeks to regain power by obtaining the Dragon Medallions. Liu Kang and Kung Lao embark on a quest to prevent Shang Tsung from achieving his goals, facing iconic Mortal Kombat characters like Kano, Baraka, and Reptile along the way. The story expands on the lore of the Mortal Kombat universe, offering players a deeper look into the world and its characters.
