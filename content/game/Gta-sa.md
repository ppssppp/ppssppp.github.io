Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (GTA: San Andreas)  launched for the PlayStation 2 in October 2004, and it quickly became a phenomenon.  This action-adventure game from Rockstar Games puts players in the shoes of Carl "CJ" Johnson, a man returning home to Los Santos after a stint away. CJ finds his old stomping grounds embroiled in gang warfare, and he's drawn back into the criminal underworld.

What made San Andreas special? Here are some key features:

* **Open World:**  San Andreas wasn't just a big map; it was a sprawling world encompassing three cities (Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas) modeled after Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas, respectively. Players could explore the cities and surrounding countryside freely, stealing cars, engaging in missions, or just causing mayhem.

* **Story and Characters:**  The story of CJ's rise to power within the Grove Street Families gang is compelling, with a great cast of characters.  The game doesn't shy away from mature themes,  but it also has a good dose of humor.

* **Customization:**  CJ can improve his physical stats by working out, eating, and learning new fighting styles. Players can also customize his clothes, cars, and even his weapons.

* **Side Activities:**  In addition to the main story missions, there are tons of things to do in San Andreas. Players can gamble in casinos, race cars, participate in gang wars, or just relax at the beach.

* **Cheats:**  San Andreas is famous for its extensive cheat codes, allowing players to do everything from spawning unlimited health to turning pedestrians into chickens. 

Even by today's standards, San Andreas remains a classic.  While the graphics might seem dated, the gameplay and world design are timeless.  If you're looking for a deep and immersive open-world experience to play on your PS2,  Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a must-have.
