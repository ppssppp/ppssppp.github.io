Def Jam on the PS2 isn't just a fighting game, it's a hip-hop experience.  While there were actually two Def Jam titles on the PS2,  the most well-known is likely Def Jam: Fight for NY, released in 2004.

**Fight for New York** puts you in the shoes of an up-and-coming underground fighter clawing your way to the top of the NYC underground fight scene.  Along the way, you'll face off against iconic rappers like  DMX, Funkmaster Flex, and even  Ludacris, each with their own unique fighting styles. The game features an engaging story mode, brutal fighting mechanics, and an atmosphere steeped in hip-hop culture.

Here's a quick rundown of what made Def Jam: Fight for NY a classic:

* **Fight alongside (or against) hip-hop legends:**  The game's roster included  real-life rappers  who lent not just their likenesses but also their voices to the game.
* **Brutal brawling:**  The combat was intense and satisfying, with a focus on  unarmed fighting  and  environment interaction.
* **Hip-hop immersion:**  The soundtrack was phenomenal, featuring licensed tracks from a wide range of hip-hop artists, and the visuals brought the gritty world of underground fighting to life.

If you're looking for a PS2 game that combines  intense fighting  with the swagger of hip-hop culture, then Def Jam: Fight for NY is a must-play.  There was also an earlier Def Jam title for PS2, Def Jam Vendetta, released in 2003, which featured a slightly different story and roster.
