Ben 10: Protector of Earth is an action-adventure video game based on the popular Cartoon Network animated series. Developed by High Voltage Software and published by D3 Publisher in 2007, it's the second Ben 10 game and throws you into the shoes (or rather, sneakers) of Ben Tennyson, a ten-year-old boy who wields the Omnitrix, a powerful device that allows him to transform into ten different alien heroes.

**Gameplay**

* **Hero Time!**  Switch between Ben's alien forms on the fly, each with unique abilities.  Heatblast shoots fire, Four Arms boasts incredible strength, and XLR8 zooms around at super speed. Utilize each alien's strengths to overcome obstacles, solve puzzles, and combat enemies.
* **Beat down the bad guys!** Engage in thrilling combat against foes from the Ben 10 universe, including robotic drones, mutated creatures, and Ben's arch-nemesis, Vilgax.  Master combos and utilize each alien's special attacks to dominate the battlefield.
* **Explore exciting environments!**  The game takes you across various locations from the show, including Ben's hometown of Bellwood, fiery Vulkanus, and the frosty planet Frigg.  Each area offers unique challenges and secrets to uncover.
* **The Omnitrix malfunctions!**  Uh oh!  The Omnitrix glitches throughout the game, limiting the time you can stay transformed.  Manage your transformations strategically and find recharge stations to keep the heroics going.
