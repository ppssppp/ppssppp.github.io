There seems to be some confusion! Final Fantasy VII, the beloved RPG classic,  was originally released for the PlayStation 1 in 1997. It wasn't available on the PlayStation 2.

However, there is a PS2 title set in the Final Fantasy VII universe: Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII. Released in 2006, Dirge of Cerberus is an action RPG with a third-person shooter twist. It features Vincent Valentine, a recurring character from Final Fantasy VII, as the protagonist. 

So, if you're looking to play the original Final Fantasy VII, you'll need a PlayStation 1 or resort to emulators or re-releases on modern platforms. But if you're curious about a PS2 spin-off featuring Vincent Valentine, then Dirge of Cerberus might be worth checking out.
