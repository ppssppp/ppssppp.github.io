Final Fantasy XII, released in 2006 for the PlayStation 2, is the twelfth mainline entry in the beloved RPG series by Square Enix.  

**Story and Setting:**

The game takes place in the world of Ivalice, embroiled in a seemingly endless war between the empires of Archadia and Rozarria. You take on the role of Vaan, a young man thrust into the conflict seeking revenge.  The narrative unfolds as Vaan joins forces with a group of unlikely allies, each with their own motivations.  

**Gameplay:**

Final Fantasy XII departs from the series' tradition of turn-based combat,  introducing a unique gambit system. Players set up a series of gambits, essentially programmed actions for your characters, allowing for a more strategic and automated approach to battles.  You can explore a vast and detailed world,  filled with side quests, hidden treasures, and challenging foes. 

**Reception and Legacy:**

Final Fantasy XII received critical acclaim for its innovative combat system, beautiful world design, and engaging story. While some felt the gambit system made battles less interactive, the game was praised for its depth and strategic elements.  

**Finding Final Fantasy XII Today:**

While no longer available for purchase on the PlayStation Store for PS2, you can find physical copies online or at retro game stores. The game is also playable on emulators for PC, though emulation legality varies by region.  A remastered version titled Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age was released for modern consoles in 2017, offering updated visuals and gameplay tweaks. 

**Is Final Fantasy XII for you?**

If you're looking for a PS2 RPG with a deep story, strategic combat, and a beautiful world to explore, Final Fantasy XII is a great choice.  Just be prepared to invest some time into mastering the gambit system to unlock its full potential.
