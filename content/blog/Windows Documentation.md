The good news is that PPSSPP, a popular PlayStation Portable (PSP) emulator, should work well on your Snapdragon 870 device. Here's what you need to know:

* **Compatibility:**  Snapdragon 870 has enough power to run most PSP games at full speed. You can find videos on [YouTube] showing gameplay of PPSSPP on Snapdragon 870 devices. 
* **Download:** PPSSPP isn't available on the Snap Store (the app store for Ubuntu-based Linux distributions like those used with Snapdragon SoCs). You'll need to download the emulator directly from the PPSSPP website: [https://www.ppsspp.org/download/](https://www.ppsspp.org/download/).

**Here are some additional things to keep in mind:**

* **Performance:** While the Snapdragon 870 is powerful,  certain demanding PSP games might require some tweaking of the PPSSPP settings to achieve optimal performance.
* **BIOS:** You might need to download the PSP BIOS file to run PPSSPP. Downloading copyrighted BIOS files can be a legal gray area, so make sure you understand the legality in your region.
